   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

What Tmispell is?

   Tmispell is an Ispell compatible front-end for spell checking
   modules. To do the actual spell checking, for Finnish it uses the
   spell checking system Voikko[1].

   What makes Tmispell quite useful is that many programs (e.g. mail
   clients and document processors) use Ispell for spell checking. Since
   Tmispell is compatible with Ispell, these programs can use it without
   any changes needed.

   Additionally Tmispell can launch Ispell if there is no module for the
   selected language. Thus it can be used as a drop-in replacement for
   Ispell.

Usage

   Currently Tmispell has an interactive text-mode user interface that
   can be used for spell checking text. It can be started by typing

 tmispell -dsuomi file.txt

   When a misspelled word is encountered, you will be asked what to do.
   The usage of the interface should fairly obvious, but you can get
   help about keys by pressing '?'.

   If you would like to use the filters, put one of the options '-t',
   '-n' and '-h' (TeX, nroff and Sgml, respectively) in front of the
   file name to spell check. For more information about options, see the
   ispell(1) manual page.

Installation

   These instructions tell how to build and install Tmispell from
   scratch. There are also prebuilt packages for Linux distributions for
   Linux distributions. Likely you want to use them instead of doing
   installation the hard way.

    1. Compile and install Tmispell:

           ./configure
           make
           make install


       The "make install" just copies the tmispell executable and manual
       page to suitable places.

    2. Download and install Voikko[1].

    3. Create the configuration file and place it to the place where
       Tmispell looks for it. There is also an example configuration
       file tmispell.conf.example, which should be used as a template.
       (See "The configuration file format" below.) Check that the path
       names in spell checker entries point to correct places.

    4. To make other programs use Tmispell instead of Ispell, first move
       aside the original Ispell executable, and then create a link from
       "tmispell" to "ispell". For example:

             mv /usr/bin/ispell /usr/bin/ispell.real
             ln -s /usr/local/bin/tmispell /usr/bin/ispell


       Remember to change the "ispell=..." line in configuration file to
       point to the real Ispell executable.

       Other programs must also know that a Finnish spell checking is
       possible, so run the following command to create fake dictionary
       files:

             touch /usr/lib/ispell/suomi.{hash,aff}


       Note that the path might also be "/usr/share/ispell" or something
       similar, depending on your system.

    5. To check that Tmispell works properly, type the following
       command:

             ispell -dsuomi -a


       If you had specified a dictionary with identifier "suomi" in the
       configuration file, then you should see a line similar to this:

 @(#) International Ispell Version 3.1.20 compatible tmispell-voikko 0.4.3

       Now you can type words to spell check. For more information about
       this command mode, refer to the ispell(1) manual.

Program-specific information

     o Emacs (both Ispell and Flyspell modes)

       Note that you might have to add something like the following to
       your ~/.emacs configuration file, since Ispell support in Emacs
       does not know about Finnish dictionary by default:

 (setq ispell-local-dictionary-alist
       (append ispell-local-dictionary-alist
        '(("suomi"
           "[%.0-9A-Za-z\247\300-\326\330-\366\370-\377-]"
           "[^.%0-9A-Za-z\247\300-\326\330-\366\370-\377-]"
           "[':]" nil nil nil iso-8859-1))))

       Depending on your configuration, the
       ispell-local-dictionary-alist could also be
       ispell-dictionary-alist. You can change the active dictionary
       with the command "M-x ispell-change-dictionary". If you like to
       have Finnish as the default dictionary, add also:

 (setq ispell-dictionary "suomi")

       If you still encounter problems (e.g. with TeX files), try turning the
       multi byte character support of Emacs off.

     o Pspell (Sylpheed, Balsa and many more)

       Although Pspell is being replaced by Aspell, some programs still
       use it. To use Tmispell with it, you need to have pspell-ispell
       module for Pspell installed, and a file
       /usr/share/pspell/fi-ispell.pwli with the following line in it:

 /usr/lib/ispell/suomi.hash utf-8

     o Other programs (most KDE applications, LyX, ...)

       When the fake dictionary files (see Installation) exist, Finnish
       should appear in the dictionary list in these programs.

The configuration file format

   The configuration file contains spell checker entries and options. "#" is
   a comment character: everything on a line after it is ignored.

   Syntax for options is simple:

 key=value

   Note that the value string, if enclosed between quotes, may span multiple
   lines.

   Currently the options are:

   ispell

	   The location of the real Ispell executable to be called as
	   a fall-back. Note that the full path to the program should be
	   given. This option must always be specified.

   tex-command-filter

	   A list of TeX commands and their parameter lists to use when
	   filtering TeX input. The syntax is "cmdname oOpP, ...", where
	   "oOpP" is a string of characters denoting the type of
	   command's parameters. Uppercase letter means that a parameter
	   should be spell checked, lowercase that it should not. 'O'
	   and 'o' denote optional parameters, 'P' and 'p' normal
	   parameters.

   tex-environment-filter

	   A list of environments to skip when filtering TeX input.

   sgml-attributes-to-check

	   A list of SGML or HTML tag attributes to spell check.

   A dictionary specification consists of 7 strings on the same line,
   separated by whitespace and possibly enclosed in double or single quotes.
   Backslashes can be used to quote characters inside the quotes. The
   meanings of the strings are:

    1. The name by which the dictionary is known, similar to the name of
       an Ispell hash file name without the extension ".hash". This must
       be specified.

    2. The file name of the library file to load. This must be
       specified.

    3. The file name of the dictionary file that the library uses. This
       must be specified.

    4. The input encoding this module uses. E.g. UTF-8. This must be
       specified.

    5. The value of the locale variable LC_CTYPE that should be used
       with this module. This determines the default set of characters
       that are considered to belong to a word. If empty or not given,
       the value of a suitable environment variable is used.

    6. The set of additional word characters not specified by the
       locale. If not given, no additional word characters are assumed.

    7. The set of word boundary characters. They are considered to be
       a part of a word only when occurring inside one. If not given, no
       boundary characters are assumed.

   Example 1. A configuration file example

 ispell=/usr/bin/ispell.real

 suomi "/usr/local/lib/libvoikko.so.1" "/dev/null" "UTF-8" "fi_FI@euro" "." "-':"

 tex-command-filter="begin po, end p, usepackage op, newcommand poOP"
 tex-environment-filter="equation $ eqnarray displaymath math"

   The first line of the configuration file just specifies the location
   of the fallback ispell program to use

   The second line adds a module for Finnish, identified by the name
   "suomi", which uses the given library file associated with
   a dictionary file. The input encoding to use is UTF-8. Only the
   letters specified by the locale "fi_FI@euro" and period are
   considered as word characters, and the boundary characters are "-",
   "'" and ":".

   So every time when Tmispell is invoked with "-d suomi" or "-d
   /usr/lib/ispell/suomi.hash" as arguments, the Voikko module is used
   for spell checking. Otherwise the Ispell program is started instead.

   The fifth line specifies that in TeX filter mode the parameters to
   commands begin{}, end{} and usepackage{} should not be spell checked,
   whereas the second optional and second obligatory parameters to
   newcommand should.

   The sixth line specifies that in TeX filter mode no math environment
   should be spell checked.

Known issues

  Missing features

     o Implement entity encoding and decoding in SGML filter. To do this
       reasonably, some changes are likely required in filter
       architecture.

  Other things to do

     o Investigate how Aspell support could be implemented. Is there
       a need for a Voikko-compatible Aspell?

     o Think about Ispell extended characters (whatever they are).
