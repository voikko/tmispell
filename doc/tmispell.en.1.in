.TH "TMISPELL" "1" "2006-07-26"

.SH "NAME"

tmispell \- an
.BR ispell (1)
compatible front-end for the spellchecking system Voikko.

.SH "SYNOPSIS"

.PP
.B tmispell
.RB [ \-F
.IR config_file ]
.RI [ Ispell_options ]
.RI [ file " ...]"

.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
.B Tmispell
is an
.BR ispell (1)
compatible front-end for spell checking modules. The actual
spellchecking for Finnish is done with the spellchecking system
.IR Voikko .

.PP
What makes
.B Tmispell
very useful is that many programs (mail clients and word
processors for example) use
.BR ispell (1)
for spellchecking. Since
.B Tmispell
is a transparent front-end for
.BR ispell (1),
other programs that would use Ispell can use Tmispell without any
changes needed. Additionally
.B Tmispell
is able to launch
.BR ispell (1)
if there is no module for the selected language. Thus
.B Tmispell
can be used as a drop-in replacement for
.BR ispell (1).

.SH "OPTIONS"

.PP
Tmispell understands the following options:

.TP 10
.BI \-F " config_file"
Read the configuration file
.I config_file
instead of the default
.IR /etc/tmispell.conf .

.TP 10
.I Ispell_options
Tmispell should understand all the options that Ispell does. For more
information about them, see
.BR ispell (1).

.SH "FILES"

.TP 10
.I /etc/tmispell.conf
The default configuration file for Tmispell.

.PP
The configuration file contains spellchecker entries and options. The
\*(lq#\*(rq is a comment character and everything on a line after it is
ignored.

.PP
Syntax for options is simple:

.RS 10
.IR key = value
.RE

.PP
Note that the
.I value
string, if enclosed between quotes, may span multiple lines.

.PP
Currently the options are:

.IP "ispell" 10
The location of the real Ispell executable to be called as a fall-back.
Note that the full path to the program must be given. This option must
always be specified.

.IP "tex-command-filter" 10
A list of TeX commands and their parameter lists to use when
filtering TeX input. The syntax is
.RB \*(lq "cmdname oOpP" ", ...\*(rq,"
where
.B oOpP
is a string of characters denoting the type of command's parameters.
Uppercase letter means that a parameter should be spellchecked,
lowercase that it should not.
.B O
and
.B o
denote optional parameters, 
.B P
and
.B p
normal parameters.

.IP "tex-environment-filter" 10
A list of environments to skip when filtering TeX input.

.IP "sgml-attributes-to-check" 10
A list of SGML or HTML tag attributes to spellcheck.

.PP
A dictionary specification consists of 7 strings on the same line,
separated by whitespace (i.e. space or tab) and possibly enclosed in
double (") or single (\(aq) quotes. Backslashes (\e) can be used to
escape quote characters inside the quotes. The meanings of the strings
are:

.RS
.IP "1." 4
The name by which the dictionary is known, similar to the name of an
.BR ispell (1)
hash file name without the extension \*(lq.hash\*(rq. This must be specified.

.IP "2." 4
The file name of the library file to load. This must be specified.

.IP "3." 4
The file name of the dictionary file that the library uses. This must be
specified.

.IP "4." 4
The input encoding this module uses, for example UTF-8. This must be
specified.

.IP "5." 4
The value of the locale variable
.B LC_CTYPE
that should be used with this module. This determines the default set of
characters that are considered to belong to a word. If empty or not
given, the value of a suitable environment variable is used.

.IP "6." 4
The set of additional word characters not specified by the locale. If
not given, no additional word characters are assumed.

.IP "7." 4
The set of word boundary characters. They are considered to be a part of
a word only when occurring inside one. If not given, no boundary
characters are assumed.

.RE

.SH "EXAMPLES"

.PP
.B A configuration file example

.RS
.PP
ispell=/usr/bin/ispell.real
.br
suomi "/usr/lib/libvoikko.so.1" "/dev/null" "UTF-8" "fi_FI.UTF-8" ".-" "\(aq':"
.br
tex-command-filter="begin po, end p, usepackage op, newcommand poOP"
.br
tex-environment-filter="equation $ eqnarray displaymath math"
.RE

.PP
The first line specifies the location of the fall-back ispell program to
use

.PP
The second line defines a module for Finnish, identified by the name
\*(lqsuomi\*(rq, which uses the given library file associated with
a dictionary file. The input encoding to use is UTF-8. Only the letters
specified by the locale fi_FI.UTF-8 as well as a period (.) and a dash
(\-) are considered as word characters. Boundary characters are
\*(lq\(aq\*(rq, \*(lq'\*(rq (U+2019) and \*(lq:\*(rq.

.PP
So every time when
.B Tmispell
is invoked with \*(lq\-d suomi\*(rq or \*(lq\-d
/usr/lib/ispell/suomi.hash\*(rq as arguments, the Voikko spellchecking
system is used for spellchecking. Otherwise the
.BR ispell (1)
is started.

.PP
The third line specifies that in TeX filter mode the parameters to
commands begin{}, end{} and usepackage{} should not be spellchecked,
whereas the second optional and second obligatory parameters to
\*(lqnewcommand\*(rq should.

.PP
The fourth line specifies that in TeX filter mode no math environment
should be spellchecked.
