.TH "TMISPELL" "1" 
.SH "NAME" 
tmispell \(em       An Ispell compatible front end for the spell checking module Soikko. 
 
.SH "SYNOPSIS" 
.PP 
\fBtmispell\fR [\fB-F\fP \fIconfigfile\fR]  [\fIIspell options\fR]  [\fIfiles\fR \&...]  
.SH "DESCRIPTION" 
.PP 
Tmispell is an Ispell compatible front-end for spell checking 
modules. To do the actual spell checking, for Finnish it uses the 
high-quality spell checking module  
\fISoikko (link to URL http://www.iki.fi/~pry/soikko/) \fR, which 
is made by Pasi Ryhänen. 
 
.PP 
What makes Tmispell quite useful is that many programs (e.g. mail 
clients and document processors) use Ispell for spell 
checking. Since Tmispell is compatible with Ispell, these programs 
can use it without any changes needed. 
 
.PP 
Additionally Tmispell can launch Ispell if there is no module for 
the selected language. Thus it can be used as a drop-in 
replacement for Ispell. 
 
.SH "OPTIONS" 
.PP 
Tmispell understands the following options: 
.IP "\fB-F \fIconfigfile\fR\fP" 10 
Read the configuration file 
\fIconfigfile\fR instead of the 
default configuration file \fB@CONFIG_FILE@\fP. 
 
.IP "\fB\fIIspell options\fR\fP" 10 
Tmispell should understand all options that Ispell 
does. For more information about them, see ispell(1). 
.SH "FILES" 
.IP "\fB@CONFIG_FILE@\fP" 10 
The configuration file for Tmispell. 
 
.IP "" 10 
The configuration file contains spell checker entries and options. 
"#" is a comment character: everything on a line after it is ignored. 
 
.IP "" 10 
Syntax for options is simple: 
 
.PP 
.nf 
\fIkey\fR=\fIvalue\fR 
.fi 
Note that the value string, if enclosed between quotes, may span 
multiple lines. 
 
.IP "" 10 
Currently the options are: 
 
 
.RS 
.IP "ispell" 10 
The location of the real Ispell executable to 
be called as a fall-back. Note that the full path to the 
program should be given. This option must always be 
specified. 
.IP "tex-command-filter" 10 
A list of TeX commands and their parameter lists to use when 
filtering TeX input. The syntax is 
"\fIcmdname\fR \fIoOpP\fR, ...",  
where "oOpP" is a string of characters denoting the type 
of command's parameters. Uppercase letter means that 
a parameter should be spell checked, lowercase that it 
should not. 'O' and 'o' denote optional parameters, 
'P' and 'p' normal parameters. 
 
.IP "tex-environment-filter" 10 
A list of environments to skip when filtering 
TeX input. 
.IP "sgml-attributes-to-check" 10 
A list of SGML or HTML tag attributes to spell 
check. 
.RE 
 
.IP "" 10 
A dictionary specification consists of 7 strings on the same line, 
separated by whitespace and possibly enclosed in double or 
single quotes. Backslashes can be used to quote characters 
inside the quotes. The meanings of the strings are: 
 
 
.RS 
.IP "   0." 6 
The name by which the dictionary is known, 
similar to the name of an Ispell hash file name without the 
extension ".hash". This must be specified. 
 
.IP "   1." 6 
The file name of the library file to load. This must 
be specified. 
 
.IP "   2." 6 
The file name of the dictionary file that the library 
uses. This must be specified. 
 
.IP "   3." 6 
The input encoding this module uses. E.g. latin9. This 
must be specified. 
 
.IP "   4." 6 
The value of the locale variable \fBLC_CTYPE\fP that 
should be used with this module. This determines the default set of 
characters that are considered to belong to a word. If empty or not 
given, the value of a suitable environment variable is 
used. 
 
.IP "   5." 6 
The set of additional word characters not specified by 
the locale. If not given, no additional word 
characters are assumed. 
 
.IP "   6." 6 
The set of word boundary characters. They are 
considered to be a part of a word only when occurring 
inside one. If not given, no boundary characters are 
assumed.

.SH "EXAMPLES" 
.PP 
\fBA configuration file example\fR 
.PP 
.nf 
ispell=/usr/bin/ispell.real 
 
suomi "/usr/local/OpenOffice.org1.0/program/libsoikko.so" "/usr/local/OpenOffice.org1.0/share/dict/soikko-sp.fi_FI.dic" "latin9" "fi_FI@euro" "." "\-':" 
 
tex-command-filter="begin po, end p, usepackage op, newcommand poOP" 
tex-environment-filter="equation $ eqnarray displaymath math" 
.fi 
.PP 
The first line of the configuration file just specifies the location 
of the fallback ispell program to use 
.PP 
The second line adds a module for Finnish, identified by the 
name "suomi", which uses the given library file associated with a 
dictionary file. The input encoding to use is iso-8859-15 
aka "latin9". Only the letters specified by the 
locale "fi_FI@euro" and period are considered as word characters, 
and the boundary characters are "\-", "'" and ":". 
 
.PP 
So every time when Tmispell is invoked with "\-d suomi" or 
"\-d /usr/lib/ispell/suomi.hash" as arguments, the Soikko 
module is used for spell checking. Otherwise the Ispell 
program is started instead. 
 
.PP 
The fifth line specifies that in TeX filter mode the parameters 
to commands begin{}, end{} and usepackage{} should not be spell 
checked, whereas the second optional and second obligatory 
parameters to newcommand should. 
 
.PP 
The sixth line specifies that in TeX filter mode no math environment 
should be spell checked.
