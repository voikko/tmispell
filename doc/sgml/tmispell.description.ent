    Tmispell is an Ispell compatible front-end for spell checking
    modules. To do the actual spell checking, for Finnish it uses the
    high-quality spell checking module 
    <ulink url="http://www.iki.fi/~pry/soikko/">Soikko</ulink>, which
    is made by Pasi Ryhänen.

    What makes Tmispell quite useful is that many programs (e.g. mail
    clients and document processors) use Ispell for spell
    checking. Since Tmispell is compatible with Ispell, these programs
    can use it without any changes needed.

    Additionally Tmispell can launch Ispell if there is no module for
    the selected language. Thus it can be used as a drop-in
    replacement for Ispell.
