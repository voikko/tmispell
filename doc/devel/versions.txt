Version numbering scheme is X.Y.Z, where each triplet (X, Y, Z) is
bijectively mapped to a single release.

X \in {0, 1, ...}

	Denotes the fully accomplished feature set of the program.
	Will change to 1 some day when all necessary features are
	implemented and the program is proven to be mature.

Y \in {0, 1, ...}

	Is incremented when notable features are added, or major
	re-engineering is done. Thus for each X, the Y's form
	a monotonous sequence, which may not converge.

	Y is set to 0, when X changes.

Z \in {0, 1, ...}

	Is incremented when small features are added or fixes are made.
	Also this sequence is monotonous for each pair (X, Y),
	and necessarily does not converge.

	Z is set to 0, when Y changes.
